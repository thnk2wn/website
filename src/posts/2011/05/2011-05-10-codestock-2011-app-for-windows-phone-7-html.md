The most excellent [CodeStock](http://codestock.org) conference is just around the corner on June 3-4th and I'm really looking forward to it. [Michael Neel](http://www.vinull.com/) and company have done a great job with this Knoxville-based developer / IT / entrepreneurs conference and it has come a long way in a short time since its inception in 2008. It just keeps getting better every year.  
  

This year on the spur of the moment I decided to write a WP7 app to manage the schedule on my shiny new Samsung Focus. Developing for Windows phone is such a pleasant experience and the nice CodeStock API made it even easier. This was my first mobile app on any platform that I have submitted to a marketplace; I had a lot of fun coding it and certainly learned a good deal.  
  

If you are going to CodeStock and you have a WP7 device you should check it out (both of you ![](images/4.gif)). Even if not, feel free to play with the source, fork it, report issues etc. I'd love to hear feedback either way, good or bad. I'm always looking for better ways to do things and I know there is a lot of room for improvement.

### Overview Video

The below video gives an overview of most of the features minus twitter sharing and a few miscellaneous ones. Note that the video codec used in recording washed the colors out and otherwise degraded the images and fonts a bit; it does look a lot better live but this gets the idea across. There are also some screenshots in my [CodeStock Flickr album](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thnk2wn/sets/72157626700656516/detail/).
